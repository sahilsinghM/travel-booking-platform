You are an expert full-stack web developer. I want you to build a complete, production-ready website for a travel booking company. Follow modern best practices, clean architecture, and use the latest frameworks.

### Project Overview
Build a **travel booking platform** where users can:
- Browse destinations and travel packages.
- Filter by location, price, and duration.
- View details of each package (itinerary, images, inclusions, etc.).
- Book a trip (collect basic info + payment).
- Receive booking confirmation via email.
- Admins can add/edit/remove travel packages.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: **React + Tailwind CSS + React Router + Axios**
- Backend: **Node.js + Express**
- Database: **MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)**
- Authentication: **JWT-based user login/signup**
- Payments: **Stripe integration** (sandbox/test mode)
- Email: **Nodemailer** for confirmations
- Deployment: **Vercel for frontend**, **Render for backend**

### Pages & Components
1. **Home Page**
   - Hero section with search bar (destination/date)
   - Featured destinations
   - Testimonials & call to action

2. **Destinations / Packages Page**

   - “Book Now” button

4. **Booking Page**

6. **Admin Dashboard**

### UI Guidelines
- Modern, minimalistic travel design.

- Rounded cards, large visuals, responsive design.
- Use Tailwind for styling and Framer Motion for animations.

### Additional Requirements
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- SEO-optimized meta tags
- Error handling & loading states
- Environment variables setup for API keys
- Clean folder structure:


create a plan for the project and write the code for the project and a design for the frontend in a clean way.
