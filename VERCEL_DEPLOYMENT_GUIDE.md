# 🚀 Complete Vercel Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Install Node.js

### Download Node.js
1. Go to **https://nodejs.org/**
2. Click the **"LTS"** button (recommended version)
3. Download the Windows installer (.msi file)
4. Run the installer with default settings
5. **Important:** Check "Add to PATH" during installation

### Verify Installation
After installation, **restart your PowerShell/Command Prompt** and run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers (like v18.x.x and 9.x.x)

## Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Once Node.js is installed, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd "C:\Users\Shail Singh\Documents\travel\frontend"

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# This will install all packages (~2-3 minutes)
```

---

## Step 3: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Your app will open at http://localhost:3000
# Test that everything works, then stop with Ctrl+C
```

---

## Step 4: Build for Production

```bash
# Build the production version
npm run build

# This creates a 'dist' folder with optimized files
```

---

## Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

### Install Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel
```

### Deploy
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Login/Signup to Vercel account
# 2. Link to existing project or create new
# 3. Confirm settings (should auto-detect Vite)
# 4. Deploy!
```

---

## Step 6: Configure Vercel (Auto-detected)

Vercel should automatically detect:
- **Framework:** Vite
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`

---

## 🎉 Success!

After deployment, you'll get:
- ✅ **Live URL** (like `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS**
- ✅ **Global CDN**
- ✅ **Automatic deployments** on code changes

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If npm is not recognized:
1. Restart your terminal/PowerShell
2. Check if Node.js is in PATH
3. Try running from Command Prompt instead

### If build fails:
1. Check all files are in place
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Check for any error messages

### If Vercel deployment fails:
1. Make sure you're in the frontend directory
2. Check that `dist` folder was created
3. Verify Vercel account is logged in
